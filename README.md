# Real-Time Emotion-Based Music Recommendation System

A real-time emotion detection system that analyzes facial expressions through a camera feed and recommends songs based on the detected emotion. This system uses **facial emotion recognition** and integrates with music APIs to provide personalized music recommendations suited to the user's emotional state.

## üìå Overview

This project leverages **OpenCV** and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** for real-time facial emotion recognition from a camera feed. Based on the detected emotion, the system fetches music recommendations from an external music API like **YouTube Data API** or **Spotify API**, offering personalized playlists for the user's mood. The system can detect emotions such as **Happy**, **Sad**, **Angry**, **Surprised**, and **Neutral**, and recommend music accordingly.

## üß† Features

- **Real-Time Emotion Detection** using a webcam feed.
- **Emotion Classification** into categories such as **Happy**, **Sad**, **Angry**, **Surprised**, **Neutral**.
- **Music Recommendation** based on the detected emotion (e.g., happy music for happy emotions, calm music for sad emotions).
- Integration with **YouTube Data API** (or **Spotify API**) for fetching songs and playlists.
- Display of emotion on the webcam feed in real-time.
- Audio or video playback of recommended songs.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **OpenCV** for real-time facial emotion detection
- **Keras / TensorFlow** for emotion classification (using CNN models)
- **Music APIs** (YouTube Data API, Spotify API, or similar)
- **NumPy** for numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** for visualizations (optional)
- **Flask** (if integrating into a web interface)
